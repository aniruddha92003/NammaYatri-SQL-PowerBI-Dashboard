# üöñ NammaYatri Trips Dashboard | SQL + Power BI 

## üöÄ Project Description

The **NammaYatri Trips Dashboard** is a data analytics and visualization project based on trip data from the NammaYatri app, which is primarily used in **Bengaluru, India**. Using **SQL** for querying and **Power BI** for dashboarding, this project explores key metrics like completed trips, earnings, driver performance, and conversion rates. The dashboard helps uncover trends in user behavior, cancellations, and area-wise activity across the city. It demonstrates how real-world urban mobility data can be transformed into meaningful insights to support smarter transportation decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
üî∑ SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL):

= Cleaned and prepared raw ride data using CTEs, JOINS, aggregation, and date-time functions.

- Generated KPIs like ride counts, conversion rates, and driver earnings.

WHERE rnk <= 5;

-- Duration with Most Trips
SELECT duration, COUNT(DISTINCT tripid) AS cnt 
FROM trips 
GROUP BY duration
